# Hi there. I'm Niracha!

I have background in digital marketing, (Agile) project management, UX/UI and a tiny bit of web development. My journey in web development is driven by a desire to transform creative ideas into interactive digital experiences, to find fulfillment in creating websites and applications that bring positive benefits to individuals or businesses.

A bit about meâœ¨:

* ðŸŒ± My interest in coding has led me to participating in ***Web Development Bootcamp*** with neuefische
* ðŸ§­ I enjoy outdoor activities, painting, puzzle games, traveling and flying/planes. 
* ðŸŽ¯ The top 5 things on my bucket list are:

  - [x] Develop my own app/website : [Capstone project- Expiry Track (ongoing)](https://github.com/NirachaMarchett/capstone-expiration-tracking-app) ðŸš€
  - [ ] Northern light hunting
  - [ ] Skydiving
  - [ ] Handshake with kangaroos
